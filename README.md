# About The App:

This app is designed to demonstrate my programming skills and solutions to common development tasks.

## Tech Stack:

It's developed in React, including Redux for more optimized and flexible state management, fetch requests to get data from the public WGER API, and shared components to conditionally manage the content depending on the state. The main layout is split into two components - a select field and a list of results fetched from API. The loading spinner is displayed after each fetch requests and the error page in case fetching failed. Basic styles are created using CSS.

## How To Use The App:

Run `npm install` and `npm start` to render the app in localhost. Choose an option from the select field that contains muscle types and find more details such as the exercise name, description and other muscles the exercise trains.
